# CoD4Organizer
 An organizer for Call of Duty 4 to apply custom camos to weapons.
 
# THIS MAY REQUIRE MORE TESTING
From what I have tested on my PC, it works fine, however this may be different for other computers. If this is the case, leave an issue explaining what is going on.
 
# How to install / uninstall
Go to the releases tab, and download the .exe, place the exe in your Call of Duty 4/main folder, and run it. Allow administrator privileges, and click Install, this will start renaming and creating files needed for it.

If you want to uninstall the custom camos, open the exe again and click on Remove, this will restore the files to their original state.

# How to install custom camos
If you don't have custom camos already, look on CFGFactory or in other places where they may be uploaded, after installing through the exe, open 'localized_english_iw07.iwd' as archive with 7-Zip or WinRAR, open the 'images' folder in there and paste your camos in there. 
You should be able to open your game and join the server.

# Impure client detected
This means that the server you are trying to join has protection against 'modifying' your client, servers like 'C4S' have nothing against custom camos therefore you are able to join this server without any consequence.
If you want to play that server, you will have to temporarily remove your camo files, copy 'localized_english_iw07' to a different directory such as your Desktop, and copy it back when you are finished.
